# WireGuard Setup Guide for Beginners

## Introduction
**WireGuard** is a lightweight, high-performance VPN that uses modern cryptography to secure internet traffic. This guide walks beginners through setting up a WireGuard VPN server and connecting clients (e.g., laptops, phones).

---

## Disclaimer
You must have a **Linux server** (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.) with **root or sudo privileges**.  
You also need a separate **client device** (such as Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, or another Linux machine) to connect to the VPN.  
If you do **not** have both a Linux server and a separate client device, this guide will **not** apply to your setup.

## What is a VPN?
A **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure tunnel. This hides your IP address and protects your data from potential eavesdroppers on insecure networks (such as public Wi-Fi). It can also let you securely access remote services or devices as if they were on your local network.

**WireGuard** is a modern VPN protocol known for its simplicity, speed, and robust cryptography. Compared to older protocols like OpenVPN or IPSec, WireGuard is lighter, easier to configure, and often faster.
